Assessment // Please Read The Instruction Below Carefully //
===

# Submission

This assessment is given 2 days to complete.
The following are to be zip and send to
gading@glints.com :

- The design of the program, flowchart and explanation

- The program source codes

- Readme text to include instruction on how to run/use the program

  - Link to the online coding platform, if any, to be included

  - Include any references that you used in your design or coding

- Any other resources (optional)

# Description

Develop, in any language of your choice,
a Tic-Tac-Toe game with Artificial Intelligence (AI)
to allow a single player to play with the computer.

a) Design and describe an algorithm using flowchart to show the flow
  of the program, including the AI decision in response to the player
  input

b) Write a program to implement the algorithm that you have
  designed in (a). Your program should be sufficiently documented
  with comments

# Additional Notes

- Displaying the Tic-Tac-Toe board is up to you

  - Ensure that the display follow a 3x3 grid system

- How player input their decision is up to you
  (e.g. player can input “1”, ”2”, ”3”, etc to mark their decision)

  - Ensure that inputs are validated
    (e.g. characters are rejected / only allows empty spot
    to be selected)

- Starting turn should be random between player and AI

- Scoring is not required

- Usage of online coding platform is recommended (https://repl.it/)

# Grading Criteria
